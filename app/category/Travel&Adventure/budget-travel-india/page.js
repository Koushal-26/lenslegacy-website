      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-2">2. Stay in Hostels or Guesthouses</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        Hostels and homestays are cheaper than hotels. Sites like Hostelworld and Airbnb help you find budget options.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-2">3. Eat Like a Local</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        Street food in India is delicious and cheap. Try samosas, chole bhature, or dosa at local stalls to save money and enjoy local flavors.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-2">4. Use Public Transport</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        Trains and buses are very affordable in India. Apps like IRCTC and RedBus help book tickets easily.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-2">5. Travel Off-Season</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        Avoid holidays and peak seasons. Prices for travel and stays drop a lot during off-season times.
      </p>
